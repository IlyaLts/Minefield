# Minefield #

As a Minesweeper lover, and since Microsoft removed the original Minesweeper, I decided to make my own version of it.

Minefield is a classic Minesweeper clone that has an automatic difficulty adjustment feature that adapts to your skill level.

The rules are simple: click on a tile to reveal what's underneath. If it's a mine, you lose. If it's a number,
it tells you how many mines are adjacent to that tile. If it's blank, it means there are no mines nearby and
the surrounding tiles are automatically revealed. You can also right-click on a tile to mark it as a mine or as uncertain.
Additionally, you can use the chording feature, by middle-clicking a numbered tile to reveal its surrounding tiles,
but only if you've correctly flagged the exact number of adjacent mines. Be careful, as incorrectly flagged mines will cause
you to lose. The goal is to clear all the tiles that don't have mines.
